PBE Patch 25/05 

SET 7 PBE COMPS I'VE TRIED
- 6 whispers Syfen carry 
- 6 dragonmancer 3 legend Voli carry
- Linear revel corki carry
- 6 swiftshot reroll (swift spat on jinx) 
- 7 mage zoe and mage asol duo carry (cone stack)
- 5 Cav reroll w/ lillia and syfen cav duo carry 
- 6 guardian reroll (abusing heroic presence augment)
- 9 ragewing xayah and shyvanna duo carry 
- 9 jade shi oh yu, neeko and yas trio carry 

Yet to try
- Linear guild
- Linear tempest 
- Linear shimmerscale
- Mirage | Yone reroll, daeja yas duo carry
- Astral reroll
- Scalescorn Olaf carry
- Cannoneer + trainer trist reroll
- Diana reroll
- Lee sin reroll (with blue battery setup) | On paper seems to have the same problem as syndra from set 6.5. Sucks when they build qss. 

THE TECH 
- Whisper daeja (soju proved that this is broken cause he stacks infinite due to his barrages)
- Whisper xayah (credit to showtime/emitwohs who played this in a lobby with soju. same logic to why daeja is broken with whisper) 
- Sin neeko (yet to try but seems strong in theory)
- Gadget expert | Shiv spam and make ezreal hold items early. Either reroll ezreal and other low cost swiftshots or reroll ashe into 9 jade. 
- Heroic presence | Reroll guardians when playing this augment. Very good against carries who auto or cast alot. Extremely strong. Weak against units who do big burst dmg. 
- Elise carry | Bis being ie jg gs and is actually pretty decent just go 6 whisper with syfen duo carry (soju proved this is lowkey nuts and elise gets infinite resets + untargetable) 
- Swift spat jinx and reroll her | She perma casts meaning perma stun on backline while your swiftshots kill their whole team
- Revel xayah (feathers trigger revel trait) 
- Mage spat on Ao shin, Asol, Bard
- Mage corki (no mana lock + low mana cost means with blue buff + blue battery setup just perma casts) 
- Manazane ryze (helps deal with the problem of his mana cost increasing per cast)  
 
Meta (what people are playing) 
- 6 whispers Syfen carry 
- 9 jade Shi oh yu carry
- 9 Ragewing Xayah and Shyvanna duo carry
- Astral reroll 
- Volibear reroll (6 dragonmancer 3 legend) 
- Linear guild Talon carry
- Revel corki carry

Notable mentions (not as popular as meta comps but still seen/somewhat played) 
- Linear mirage daeja and yas duo carry
- Mages | Ryze carry vairant or cone stack zoe carry
- Olaf carry 
- Linear shimmerscale
- Linear tempest
- Trainer reroll 

What's "trash"? (no one wants to try cause think it's so bad) 
Linear warrior (zero potential is literally just trash rn) 
Linear shapeshifters (more potential than warriors and I think people should be attempting to theorycraft. seems not very good on paper though)
