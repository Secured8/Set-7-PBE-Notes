Yet to try
- Linear guild
- Linear tempest 
- Linear shimmerscale
- Qiyana reroll 
 

THE TECH 
- Whisper daeja (soju proved that this is broken cause he stacks infinite due to his barrages)
- Whisper xayah (credit to showtime/emitwohs who played this in a lobby with soju. same logic to why daeja is broken with whisper) 
- Sin neeko 
- Gadget expert | Shiv spam and make ezreal hold items early. R reroll ezreal and other low cost swiftshots units . 
- Heroic presence | Reroll guardians when playing this augment. Very good against carries who auto or cast alot. Extremely strong. Weak against units who do big burst dmg.  
- Swift spat jinx and reroll her | She perma casts meaning perma stun on backline while your swiftshots kill their whole team
- Revel xayah (feathers trigger revel trait) 
- Mage spat on Ao shin, Asol, Bard
- Mage corki 
- Manazane ryze (helps deal with the problem of his mana cost increasing per cast)  
- Dawnbringer nunu with dragonmancer spat 
- Dragonmancer pyke
